When it comes mobile devices, the Talk client embed is already responsive and mobile friendly. It is for this reason that the Coral Project has not attempted to make a Talk client available as a native iOS or Android mobile application. However, we get asked about this _a lot_!

One organization that has taken on the challenge of creating their own iOS native Talk client is IGN. They were kind enough to share some details about their process which can be found [here](talk/images/IGNNativeComments.pdf)
